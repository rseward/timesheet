# timesheet

## Goals

A Python / DJango re-implementation of the classic timesheet.php project used for
client timetracking.

Any software consultancy needs to track time spent on client tasks. This project aims to
provide this capability in as simple manner as possible. The project should enable easy generation of invoices for client work.

A secondary purpose is to gain experience on common full stack development tools and frameworks.

## Overview

Project components:
- python3.10+
- alembic (to manage the schema)
- sqlalchemy
- sqllite3 or postgres
- django
- ReactJS
- docker to easily host the project in a container
